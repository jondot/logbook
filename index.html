        <p>Logbook allows you to record memories easily from your command line into
virtual book(s). Books are simply private Github Gists (backend is
replaceable).</p>

<p>It is heavily inspired from its pythonish friend, <a href="http://maebert.github.com/jrnl">http://maebert.github.com/jrnl</a>.</p>

<p>I built it because I love Ruby, it was easy enough, and I really loved
the idea of storing as Gists as opposed to plain files.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>For brevity's sake, the Logbook gem name and executable is <code>lg</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install lg
$ lg
</code></pre>

<p>If you want private Gists attached to your user (you most probably
want that), make sure to set your Github credentials as environment
variables, example:</p>

<pre><code>$ export GITHUB_USER=youruser
$ export GITHUB_PASSWORD=yourpw
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to make a first <code>book</code> and start <code>add</code>ing into it.  </p>

<h2>Setting up a book</h2>

<p>Create a new book with the <code>lg book</code> command. You can give it a
cover, in this case <code>The Wizzard of Oz</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ lg book The Wizzard of Oz
</code></pre>

<h2>Adding things</h2>

<p>Simply say 'lg add' and your memory in a short sentence.</p>

<pre><code>$ lg add just wrote the logbook gem README
</code></pre>

<p>You might find it convenient to specify when a thing happend explicitly,
just make sure to specify a natural date such as <code>yesterday</code> separated
by a colon <code>:</code>. Translation done with the <code>chronic</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>$ lg add yesterday: wrote the logbook gem README
</code></pre>

<h2>More</h2>

<p>You can safely skip this if that's all what you're looking for.</p>

<h2>Switching books</h2>

<p>Switch between books, when you know what you want, you can explicitly
specify the ID.</p>

<pre><code>$ lg book book-id
</code></pre>

<p>Or pick from a menu, leaving arguments blank:</p>

<pre><code>$ lg book
1    The Wizzard of Oz   deadbeef0aef
...
Pick one: 1
</code></pre>

<h2>Listing things</h2>

<p>Say <code>lg all</code> when you want to see everything you've recorded.</p>

<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>Command line is awesome. Its fast, and you feel it when you're less
dependent on your mouse for your development work (e.g. VIM).  </p>

<p>You should just Alt/Command-Tab, write a line and go back working.  </p>

<p>You should be expected to remember at most one commands (pitfall of success) to do actual work. Seriously, <a href="http://ezliu.com/focus/">focus</a>.</p>

<h2>There's no search like in jrnl</h2>

<p>Feature slim. Use gist search for that. True, its limited, but as of now, I believe
Github are working on improving that.  </p>

<p>In actuallity, <code>jrnl</code>'s search loads all of your entries to memory and
performs search on an in-memory structure.<br>
If the need arises, it should be dead easy to
make <em>that</em> kind of search in <code>logbook</code>.</p>

<h2>There's no delete/modify</h2>

<p>Again, feature slim. If you were using a real logbook, you'd
just cross the bad entry. It will still be there.<br>
If you must, you can always use the gist interface for that.  </p>

<h2>There's no analytics, let me reap added value from my work!</h2>

<p>Actually, a gist entry is a Git repository.<br>
The modeling on-top-of a
Gist was done intentionally. Clone your book and
treat it like a Git repo.</p>

<p>From there, you can script against git and/or run countless analysis tools on your repository.</p>

<h1>Developers</h1>

<p>Set up development: <code>git clone</code>, <code>bundle install</code>, <code>bundle exec guard start</code>.<br>
Build/install a development snapshot: <code>rake build</code>, <code>rake install</code>.</p>
